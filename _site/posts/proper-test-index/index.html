<p>In No Laying Up’s coverage of the 125th U.S. Open at Oakmont, the Big Man himself introduced a metric that has lodged itself in my brain: the Proper Test Index (PTI). It’s defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
PTI = \frac{\text{Number of rounds with a score &gt;= 80}}{\text{Number of rounds with a score of &lt; 70}}
\]</span></p>
<p>He ran through some of the numbers across past U.S. Opens; what does it look like when we extend the metric to the PGA Tour? Using Data Golf’s API, I pulled the scoring data for their entire archive and calculated the event-level PTI:</p>

<p>As much as I like Brooks Koepka…, the 2018 PGA Championship at Bellerive CC wasn’t particularly <em>proper</em>. But good news for Big! Phil the Thrill’s unbelievable performance in the 2021 PGA Championship at Ocean Course at Kiawah Island was undeniable. Proper.</p>

<p>PTI tells us something about the balance of extreme rounds at the event level. What if we adopt Baseball’s <em>park factor</em> to figure out if a low round really matters?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Course Factor} = \frac{\frac{\text{Total scores &gt;= 80 at the course}}{\text{Total scores &lt; 70 at the course}}}{\frac{\text{Total scores &gt;= 80 at all other courses}}{\text{Total scores &lt; 70 at all other courses}}}

<p>The larger the <em>course factor</em>, the more impressive a 65 is! Let’s plot out the <em>course factor</em> across the available venues.</p>

<p>Wow. The scale of course factor is pretty intense. An above average round at Ocean Course at Kiawah Island is worth 1955 times more than a similarly above average round at Sea Island GC (Seaside). A logarithmic scale gives us a bit more insight into how the course factor relates to pure scoring average.</p>
