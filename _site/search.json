    "text": "Introduction\nIn No Laying Up’s coverage of the 125th U.S. Open at Oakmont, the Big Man himself introduced a metric that has lodged itself in my brain: the Proper Test Index (PTI). It’s defined as\n\\[\nPTI = \\frac{\\text{Number of rounds with a score &gt;= 80}}{\\text{Number of rounds with a score of &lt; 70}}\n\\]\nHe ran through some of the numbers across past U.S. Opens, but what does it look like when we extend the metric to the PGA Tour? Using Data Golf’s API, I pulled the scoring data for their entire archive and calculated the event-level PTI:\n\n\n   \n   \n\n\nA few things stood out to me.\n\nThe pros are really good. Across the entire dataset, only 1.0% of rounds have a score of 80 or over. That’s compared to a healthy 37.2% of rounds falling in the 60s (or lower!).\nThere are 140 events that had 0 rounds of 80 or over.\nWhat were we doing at the 2019 Wyndham Championship? 332 rounds below 70 and 0 above 80. Not Proper.\n\nNow when it comes to majors…\n\n\n   \n   \n\n\nAs much as I like Brooks Koepka…, the 2018 PGA Championship at Bellerive CC wasn’t particularly proper. But good news for Big! Phil the Thrill’s unbelievable performance in the 2021 PGA Championship at Ocean Course at Kiawah Island was undeniable. Proper."

Sure.\nWe’re seeing the effects of rare events; only 1.0% of rounds come in over 80, so if 8.3% of rounds at Ocean Course at Kiawah Island are over 80 (and only 6.4% below 70), we will see extreme values.\nWhat we need is a monotonic transformation that can compress the scale a bit. Using \\(\\log\\), we can get something a bit more readable.\n\n\n   \n   \n\n\nThis chart is more legible. Due to the strict scarcity of rounds in the 80s, we’ll be using a logarithmic transformation of course factor (\\(\\text{Course Factor}^{*}\\)) to convey the relative difficulty of each venue.\nNow comes the real question, however: Did Big Cook?\nLooking at the distribution of scores across each venue,\n\n\n   \n   \n\n\nI think Big might have cooked here! \\(\\text{Course Factor}^{*}\\) seems to correlate not only with average difficulty, but variance. In a proper test, we want to see separation between the “Men” and the “Little Boys”.\nThere’s certainly more to be said on this topic. However, next up: the Proper Player Index. Stay tuned."
