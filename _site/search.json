    "text": "Introduction\nIn No Laying Up’s coverage of the 125th U.S. Open at Oakmont, the Big Man himself introduced a metric that has lodged itself in my brain: the Proper Test Index (PTI). It’s defined as\n\\[\nPTI = \\frac{\\text{Number of rounds with a score &gt;= 80}}{\\text{Number of rounds with a score of &lt; 70}}\n\\]\nHe ran through some of the numbers across past U.S. Opens, but what does it look like when we extend the metric to the PGA Tour? Using Data Golf’s API, I pulled the scoring data for their entire archive and calculated the event-level PTI:\n\n\n   \n   \n\n\nA few things stood out to me.\n\nThe pros are really good. Across the entire dataset, only 1.0% of rounds have a score of 80 or over. That’s compared to a healthy 37.2% of rounds falling in the 60s (or lower!).\nThere are 140 events that had 0 rounds of 80 or over.\nWhat were we doing at the 2019 Wyndham Championship? 332 rounds below 70 and 0 above 80. Not Proper.\n\nNow when it comes to majors…\n\n\n   \n   \n\n\nAs much as I like Brooks Koepka…, the 2018 PGA Championship at Bellerive CC wasn’t particularly proper. But good news for Big! Phil the Thrill’s unbelievable performance in the 2021 PGA Championship at Ocean Course at Kiawah Island was undeniable. Proper."
