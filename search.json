    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis analysis is for fun! Please don’t take anything in this article too seriously. At some point, I’d love to do a deep dive on what makes a “proper” test and what it means for measuring player performance. For now, let’s get into the takes.\nIn my previous blog post, we looked at the Proper Test Index and a corresponding analysis identifying the most proper venues. What if we apply those learnings to player performance?\nThe theory is simple. let’s weight player scoring by the difficulty of the venue:\n\\[\n\\text{Proper Player Index} = \\frac{\\sum (\\text{Wave Scoring Average} - \\text{Score}) \\times \\text{Course Factor}^{*}}{\\sum \\text{Course Factor}^{*}}\n\\]\nWhen we do this type of analysis, there are some interesting consequences. Namely, there are some really low scores that don’t contribute to PPI because they come at courses that have never seen a score of 80+ from the professionals. In 2025 alone, there are 22 rounds below 65 that contribute nothing to a player’s PPI. Here are the lowest 10:\nName\nScore\nEvent\n\n\n\n\n\"Mitchell, Keith\"\n61\n\"Truist Championship\"\n\n\n\"McCarthy, Denny\"\n62\n\"Truist Championship\"\n\n\n\"Roy, Kevin\"\n62\n\"Puerto Rico Open\"\n\n\n\"Gotterup, Chris\"\n63\n\"Puerto Rico Open\"\n\n\n\"Bhatia, Akshay\"\n63\n\"Truist Championship\"\n\n\n\"Morikawa, Collin\"\n63\n\"Truist Championship\"\n\n\n\"Straka, Sepp\"\n63\n\"Truist Championship\"\n\n\n\"Hughes, Mackenzie\"\n63\n\"ONEflight Myrtle Beach Classic\"\n\n\n\"Matsuyama, Hideki\"\n63\n\"Truist Championship\"\n\n\n\"Fowler, Rickie\"\n63\n\"Truist Championship\"\nYikes. Not a good look for Philly Cricket Club."

    "text": "Comparison with Strokes Gained\nFrom a Golf Sicko perspective, the most natural comparative metric for the PPI is Strokes Gained (Total). In theory, these metrics operate on the same scale, right? Let’s take a look at a 50-round rolling average of both to see if the PPI delivers any insight.\n\n\n   \n   \n\n\nThere are 4 categories in this visualization:\n\nProper Players: above average players that rise to the moment\nImposters: above average players that fall apart in difficult conditions\nGamers: below average players that Step Up\nMules: below average players that get worse when the going gets tough\n\nIn this visualization, there is one name that stands out to me: Justin Thomas. At the time of publication, he is the single player that suffers the most when we compare PPI to Strokes Gained. So what happened? Let’s look at a 50-round rolling PPI (red) alongside his Strokes Gained (Total; in black).\nIn the hover for this chart you’ll see “gain”. That’s just the difference between the wave average and the posted score with course factor applied. For example, if you shoot 68 with a wave average of 70 on a course with an adjusted course factor of 2, the “gain” is 4 ((70 - 68) * 2)\n\n\n   \n   \n\n\nOof. I know his pain. What we are seeing here is a combination of factors. First, there are 3 excellent rounds that fall off his 50-round average in this time: a 64 at the ZOZO, 63 at The Sentry, and 64 at the AmEx. Second, a good performance at the Truist went completely unrewarded (as mentioned up top). Finally, some poor play. 80 at The Memorial is punished massively; same with a 73 at The Travelers.\nThe PPI is unforgiving!"

    "text": "In No Laying Up’s coverage of the 125th U.S. Open at Oakmont, the Big Man himself introduced a metric that has lodged itself in my brain: the Proper Test Index (PTI). It’s defined as\n\\[\nPTI = \\frac{\\text{Number of rounds with a score &gt;= 80}}{\\text{Number of rounds with a score of &lt; 70}}\n\\]\nHe ran through some of the numbers across past U.S. Opens, but what does it look like when we extend the metric to the PGA Tour? Using Data Golf’s API, I pulled historical scoring data and calculated the event-level PTI:\nA few things stood out to me.\nNow when it comes to majors…\nAs much as I like Brooks Koepka, the 2018 PGA Championship at Bellerive CC wasn’t particularly proper. But good news for Big! Phil the Thrill’s unbelievable performance in the 2021 PGA Championship at Ocean Course at Kiawah Island was undeniably a Proper Victory. Soly’s right, we somehow don’t talk about that win enough."

    "text": "Sabermetrics can help us identify Proper Venues\nPTI tells us something about the balance of extreme rounds at the event level. What if we adopt Baseball’s park factor to figure out if a low round really matters?\n\\[\n\\text{Course Factor} = \\frac{\\frac{\\text{Total scores &gt;= 80 at the course}}{\\text{Total scores &lt; 70 at the course}}}{\\frac{\\text{Total scores &gt;= 80 at all other courses}}{\\text{Total scores &lt; 70 at all other courses}}}\n\\]\nThe larger the course factor, the more impressive a 65 is! Let’s plot out the course factor across the available venues.\n\n\n   \n   \n\n\nWow. Course Factor has some range! According to this metric, An above average round at Ocean Course at Kiawah Island is worth 1954 times more than a similarly above average round at Sea Island GC (Seaside). Sure.\nWe’re seeing the effects of rare events; only 1.0% of rounds come in over 80, so if 8.3% of rounds at Ocean Course at Kiawah Island are over 80 (and only 6.4% below 70), we will see extreme values.\nWhat we need is a monotonic transformation that can compress the scale a bit. Using \\(\\log\\), we can get something a bit more readable.\n\n\n   \n   \n\n\nThis chart is more legible. Due to the strict scarcity of rounds in the 80s, we’ll be using a logarithmic transformation of course factor (\\(\\text{Course Factor}^{*}\\)) to convey the relative difficulty of each venue.\nNow comes the real question, however: Did Big Cook?\nLooking at the distribution of scores across each venue,\n\n\n   \n   \n\n\nI think Big might have cooked here! \\(\\text{Course Factor}^{*}\\) seems to correlate not only with average difficulty, but variance. In a proper test, we want to see separation between the “Men” and the “Little Boys”.\nThere’s certainly more to be said on this topic. However, next up: the Proper Player Index. Stay tuned."
